                When dealing with loss and grief, one of the strongest memory triggers for me is photography. In my artwork I use photography not only as a means to make memories, but also to respond to them. Photography has the power to channel emotions that no other medium can replicate, many of which are tied to death.

                A cameras lens only shows what is in front of it, I try to use that to my advantage, leaving spaces grey or empty in attempt to contemplate loss. Much of my work deals with my own personal experiences with death, for when I was younger I lost my mother. I hope to create photographic objects that express the dualities of the museum wall, using my own personal reflections along with objects and photographs that replicate them. I aim to use critical theories on photography as jumping points to my own meaning, specifically Roland Barthes’s “that has been,” which calls back to the ephemera of the fleeting moment.

                With the objects that I make, specifically the box with the words reading “Anna-lisa Froman” I aim to question the roll of the gallery in art works, how it alters the way we look at art objects or everyday objects when placed on the white walls. With this work coupled with the photograph of the box I hope to further raise questions on authenticity, for the truth in these two objects differ when placed together. Along with the recreated snapshots of myself I hope to further question what is an art object and its worth in the white cube.
